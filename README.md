# Computer-Vision-Side-Project
This basic computer vision project was based on an article I read earlier this year. I wanted to see if I could create something with a similar predicitve ability to the model article's author had created. I used the provided datasets and then fit a 2 layer sequential model to it. Afterwards, I took a look at the metrics of my model and tested its predictive ability. At the end I also provide anyone reading this an opportunity to see the model in action. In the future I hope to optimize this project further and find new ways to apply the knowledge I have gained from this project.
